This program basically works on A-star algorithm, where a 3X3 matrix is taken as input, having '0' as a empty space & [1 2 3; 4 5 6; 7 8 0]
as the target scenario

A-star

Selection of next configuration is done based on it's closeness to the target configuration. Therefore, the closest configuration will be select as next state.

Here, gskmadem8puzzle.m works as main function.
